### Key Objectives:

1. Study state of art image generation and domain adaptation techniques.
2. Study synthetic to real transfer techniques.
3. Study pixel-level domain adaption and test them on custom sets.
4. Study larger domain shifts during adaptation and derive key inferences and solutions.

### Dependancies:
1. pytorch
2. torchvision
3. tensorboardX 
4. numpy
